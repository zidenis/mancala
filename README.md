## Rules

The goal is to collect more seeds than your opponent does.

1. The Mancala board is made up of 2 rows of 6 holes each and 2 special-holes called Kahalas. Each player has one Kahala to the your right side of the mancala board.
2. 6 seeds are placed in each of the 12 roles.
3. The Kahalas are initially empty.
4. The game begins with one player picking up all of the seeds in one of the non-empty holes on his side.
5. Moving counter-clockwise, the player deposits one of the seeds in each hole (including kahalas) he runs until the seeds run out.
6. If the last seed you drop is in your own Kahala, you get a free turn.
7. If the last seed you drop is in an empty hole, you collect all the seeds on the hole directly opposite.
8. The game ends when all the 6 holes on one side of the mancala board are empty.
9. The player who still has seeds on his side of the board when the game ends captures all of those seeds to his kahala
10. The winner is the player with the most seeds.
